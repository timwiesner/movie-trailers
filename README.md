# Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
## Movie Trailer Website
### Project Overview
After submitting this project for Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree, my reviewer showed me how to refactor the code using Jinja2 https://github.com/wqfeng/movie-trailer.

As such, this submission for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree will be my original project refactored with Jinja2 and additional feature/style changes.
